While peatlands are responsible for the majority of C stored in wetland soils, freshwater mineral soil wetlands are also globally significant C stores. Freshwater mineral soil wetlands in North America account for approximately 40 Gt (or 18%) of the wetland C pool (Bridgham et al. 2006). Furthermore, freshwater mineral soil wetlands are typically much more productive compared to peat forming wetlands (Mitsch and Gosselink 2000; Rocha and Goulden 2009), enabling them to accumulate organic C at higher rates. \n\nDespite FWMS wetlands being important global C stores, they are also important greenhouse gas (GHG) sources. FWMS wetlands such as marshes can have high methane (CH4) fluxes on a per unit basis. \n\n",
